## 📌 Problem Statement
**SecureTrust Bank**, a mid-sized financial institution serving urban and rural India, faces significant challenges with its current manual loan verification process.

The manual system is **time-consuming, biased, and inconsistent**, leading to two critical business issues:
1.  **Loss of Business:** Good customers are sometimes rejected due to human error or bias.
2.  **Financial Loss:** High-risk customers are sometimes approved, leading to defaults.

## 💡 The Solution
As a **Machine Learning Engineer**, I designed **CreditWise**, an intelligent loan approval system that analyzes historical applicant data to predict whether a loan should be **Approved** or **Rejected** before final human verification.

The system aims to:
* Automate the initial screening process.
* Remove human bias from decision-making.
* Reduce Non-Performing Assets (NPA) by accurately identifying high-risk applicants.

## 📊 Key Workflow
1.  **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values and outliers in the dataset.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed relationships between income, credit history, and loan status.
3.  **Model Training:** Trained multiple classifiers to optimize for **F1-Score** and **Recall** (minimizing False Negatives).

📈 Results
Metric Optimized: F1-Score (to balance Precision and Recall).

Outcome: The model successfully identifies high-risk applicants, offering a faster and unbiased alternative to the manual process.
